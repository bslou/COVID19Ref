<h1 class = "kj">USA</h1>
<p class = "ox">According to the charts and according to heavy research and calculations, the cases of COVID 19 are steadily decreasing. Also, the cases go up and down back and forth but luckily the cases are trending down as opposed to up. The cases of COVID 19 thus far in the USA were the highest on May 30, 2020. There were over 3700 cases on that day. The second largest day for most cases was June 5, 2020. Luckily there are way more recovered cases for USA than dead cases. The most death USA experienced was on April 22, 2020 with 115 deaths. The ratio for recovered to death is 5:1. All in all there are 500K recoveries in the USA while there are 111K deaths.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div style = "width: 800px; border: none;" id = "brazil">
<h1 class = "kj">Brazil</h1>
<p class = "ox">Most of the known cases that are in Brazil right now are located in the city os Sao Paulo. This city has a confirmed number of 123K cases. Rio de Janeiro is the second highest city with 59K known coronavirus cases. Brazils recovery to death ratio is approximately 151:18. There are a total of 302K recoveries while there are 36K deaths in Brazil. Brazil had the most known COVID 19 cases on May 30, 2020. The number of cases rose to 33K. The numbers keep going up and down, as on June 1 the numbers dropped down significantly but climbed back up the next day. Brazil is still trending upward on cases according to the past few days. Right now Brazil has the most cases grown. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div style = "width: 800px; border: none;" id = "russia">
<h1 class = "kj">Russia</h1>
<p class = "ox">Russias cases are slowly dropping. According to the stats, Russia has a very low amount of deaths for the amount of cases they have; they have a total of 5K deaths. Luckily for Russia the cases are starting to trend downward. They have weigh more recoveries than deaths. There ratio is about 213:5 for recovery to death. That is very impressive! Russia has a total of about 450K known cases. The most known cases they ever had thus far was on May 11, 2020 when they had a total of 11656 cases in one day. Since then, Russias cases significantly decreased as now they average at about 8K cases daily. You also have to keep in mind that the population of Russia is at 144.5 million. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div style = "width: 800px; border: none;" id = "spain">
<h1 class = "kj">Spain</h1>
<p class = "ox">The cases for Spain decreased greatly. Their social distancing must be going very well! The only unfortunate news for Spain is that they have a significant amount of deaths which is 27K. The highest known amount of cases for Spain happened back on March 26, 2020 with over 9100 cases. Since then, Spains cases have been trending down at a very fast pace. At this point, Spain averages about 350 cases a day which is very incredible. Spain controlled COVID 19 really well, it would be interesting to find out what they did to prevent it. It is currently unknown what Spains recovery amount is. As a result, we cannot calculate the recovery:death ratio.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div style = "width: 800px; border: none;" id = "uk">
<h1 class = "kj">UK</h1>
<p class = "ox">United Kingdom Covid 19 cases also have been trending down but not as much as Spains. They had a small spike on May 27, 2020 with 4K cases, but that is not their highest amount. Their highest amount of cases in one day happened on May 1, 2020 with about 6.2K cases. The most deaths UK experienced in one day was 1152 on April 9, 2020. Luckily, the deaths in UK have been dropping significantly as now they average way less as they averaged before. Now, they average about 400 deaths daily. UK's recoveries are at this point not full known so recover:death ratio cannot be calculated. Overall, UK has more deaths than Russia and Spain. with about 40K deaths. UK is controlling the virus pretty well thus far. </p>

A month ago, India was looking good in terms of COVID but because of the large population, many people are getting infected with this virus. In April, India averaged about 400 cases daily but currently India averages about 9600 cases daily. Since India has gotten so many more cases of COVID 19 recently, there have been more deaths that occurred. India reached its peak of deaths on June 6, 2020 with 294 deaths. A month ago India averages about 80 deaths but currently, India averages about 285 deaths. Their recovery to death ratio is 113:6. As they have 113K recoveries while they have 6K deaths.</p>
